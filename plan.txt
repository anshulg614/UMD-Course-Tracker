Familiarize yourself with React and its basic concepts, such as components, props, and state. You can use the official 
React documentation or online tutorials to get started. (Learn as you go)

Explore the UMD API and understand how to fetch data from it. You can use tools like Postman or Insomnia to test API requests and 
responses. 

Design the UI of your app, including the layout, color scheme, and components. You can use a UI design tool like Figma or Sketch 
to create mockups. Draw UI on paper. 

Implement the functionality to fetch gened courses from the UMD API and display them in the UI. You can use React's built-in 
fetch() function or a third-party library like Axios to make API requests.

Add interactivity to your app by allowing users to select gened courses and track their progress towards fulfilling gen ed credits. 
You can use React's state management system to keep track of the selected courses and calculate the remaining credits.

Test your app thoroughly to ensure it works as expected and handles errors gracefully. You can use tools like Jest and React 
Testing Library to write unit and integration tests.

Deploy your app to a hosting service like Netlify or Heroku so that others can access it online.
